Also Kong: *takes Godzilla's deafening roar at point blank range and just roars back*",2021-06-08T00:17:19Z,209,6
Corvus Vigil — Demon Hunter,"@Schleich Horse Lover cannon that last movie Kong heard Zillas roar and ignored it, so he should already know what Zilla sounds like.
But yeah, covering your ears to *cannon fire from warships* is expected. It's not like the captain said ""tell monke that we're firing the guns""",2021-06-09T15:57:06Z,2,
Schleich Horse Lover,"true, but it may come from that the canons were pretty loud at a very unexpected time. He didnt know that they would come at such an unexpected time. This scared Kong a little or something, and then he covered his ears because he wasnt prepared for it.  

But when he roared back at Godzilla, he knew that Godzilla would create a high sound, making him prepare fot it and being more ready to take the high volume.  You can also see that he's trying to back up from the sound when Godzilla roars, and that he is kind of making a grimace that shows that he finds the sound very high and uncomfortable.

But otherwise i do agree with your comment haha",2021-06-09T06:51:39Z,6,

SaveDaLastZombie,"As far as I'm concerned. King Kong won the battle against Godzilla. At the end of the movie King Kong stands up, and roars at Godzilla like Come On Wit It challenging him & Godzilla runs off into the ocean with his tail between his legs. Kong was down to fight and Godzilla ran off. Kong wanted to keep fighting and Godzilla chickened out. That makes Kong the winner.",2021-06-07T18:16:43Z,1,0

And King Kong who is equally as strong (per their wrestling) can't even break his chains?  There is obvious distortion of strength here.  Also the missiles would cause fatal injury to any animal no matter how thick the skin.,2021-06-07T02:44:37Z,0,0

SaveDaLastZombie,@ddm62571 BS. King Kong saw Godzilla didn't want to fight him. That's why he put the axe down. Godzilla bowed out of the fight and ran off into the ocean. King Kong wanted to fight and Godzilla didn't want it with King Kong. King Kong roared at him like let's do this and Godzilla clucked like a chicken. King Kong didn't back down. Hold that L Godzilla. King Kong is / was the victor in this film.,2021-06-07T19:09:52Z,4,
ddm62571,"@SaveDaLastZombie 😆 Not what happened. Kong was facing Godzilla with the axe and then dropped his axe to the ground with Godzilla still standing there staring at him. Point being, Kong dropped his axe cuz he was done fighting Godzilla and that's when Godzilla turned and walked away. Kong forfeited.",2021-06-07T18:56:50Z,4,
SaveDaLastZombie,"As far as I'm concerned. King Kong won the battle against Godzilla. At the end of the movie King Kong stands up, and roars at Godzilla like Come On Wit It challenging him & Godzilla runs off into the ocean with his tail between his legs. Kong was down to fight and Godzilla ran off. Kong wanted to keep fighting and Godzilla chickened out. That makes Kong the winner.",2021-06-07T18:19:50Z,1,

At the end of the movie King Kong stands up, and roars at Godzilla like Come On Wit It challenging him, & Godzilla runs off into the ocean with his tail between his legs. Kong was down to fight and Godzilla ran off. Kong wanted to keep fighting and Godzilla chickened out wanting no part of it. That makes Kong the winner. So much for your King of the Monsters.",2021-06-07T18:31:29Z,2,

George Edwards,"Notice one thing...the humans attacked first and Godzilla didn't bother with them until they fired at him and he retaliates? The only reason he destroyed the planes and carriers in his path was because they attacked first.

Zach Johnson,@George Edwards you're living up to what you said about humans being dumb perfectly bud lol.,2021-06-05T02:50:23Z,4,
Zach Johnson,"@Justin Jeune actually he does know who Kong is, or at least his species. Remember that great war that was mentioned in the movie between their ancestors? Thanks to some graphic novels that take place between this film and King of the Monsters, we learn about Godzilla's past and that he has fought some of Kong's ancestors and was even defeated by one. In other words the reason he's being so ruthless in attacking Kong is that he's taking out his frustration over that loss. If you're curious and would like to learn more, the books are called Godzilla Dominium and Kingdom Kong. They're cool reads and you even get to see two of the Titans that we didn't get to see in King of the Monsters: Amhuluk and Tiamat",2021-06-05T00:34:40Z,8,

They first thought to take him by sea they did avoid all of godzillas territorial routes and some how still came to kong because godzilla is the king and king kong is also an alpha titan godzilla just came to make kong bow down to him,2021-06-04T11:39:19Z,41,

Godzilla came at him again after seeing Kong holding the weapon that could hurt him so he was going to challenge Kong once more

But Kong drops the axe after he realizes that is what was making Godzilla feel so uneasy. Him dropping the battle axe is what signaled the end of their battle not Godzilla running off with his tail between his legs.",2021-06-08T00:10:35Z,6,

Felt very bad for Kong as all he wanted was just go to Hollow Earth to find himself a home as he got all caught up with this mess as Godzilla continued on going rogue looking for a threat that's not there, pretty much messing with Godzilla's mind constantly the whole time. I also feel bad for Godzilla everyime he makes that sound when he gets hurt....always makes me sad lol!! But that fight with Mecha made me so upset seeing Godzilla getting wrecked as he did and almost taken out until Kong came finally. I agree..  I would rather of seen Godzilla fight Mecha at 100%! Would've been a whole different fight I could guarantee that! Especially when the two had that atomic breath battle....it showed that Godzilla didn't have as much power as Mecha did as he was fully charged before the battle while Godzilla was worn out obviously. Would love to see them bring Mecha back like they did in the old movies when they came out with Godzilla vs Mecha Godzilla 2. At least I would like to see Zilla have another fight... but this time fully charged!",2021-06-01T20:18:25Z,5,

Aadrit Medhi,@ethan davius The wound was not thoroughly healed and it was still relatively fresh. In fact when Mechagodzilla blasts Godzilla with the beam you can still see the wound on his thigh. And I also don't think Godzilla would be able to heal from a wound that cleaves his skull clean into two halves.,2021-06-07T02:49:02Z,2,
ethan davius,"@Aadrit Medhi Not being mean or anything but I think I know why Kong was able to knock Godzilla down and it wasn't plot Armour. It might be because Kong has the body or close to a human so of course he is agile and swift. If you take away the axe sure Kong would be weaker but his agility wouldn't be. Now if we were to take his  agility then he would get bodied no cap Godzilla just claps him in everything. It's not the axe that makes Kong worthy It's Kong himself. So no the only reason why Kong was able to Knock Godzilla down is that he is human like and can move around fast.

Fun fact to point here is that hits TO THE HEAD OR MOUTH will probably make you bleed. I feel like your not pointing out Godzilla's regen ability. Remember when Kong stabbed Godzilla's thigh with the axe? well by the time the Mecha Godzilla fight came around the wound was healed. So it didn't really matter is Kong made Godzilla bleed it would just be healed anyway :/",2021-06-07T02:41:17Z,0,

Titanium Command Rig,@Aadrit Medhi and you know this how?,2021-06-04T04:51:17Z,1,
Aadrit Medhi,@To Ade I'm talking about the Hong Kong fight. Kong clearly powers through Godzilla's bites to his neck and a body slam to a building. Then he lands a five hit combo on him. Makes him bleed with two fists and sends him flying several feet with a drop kick. Then he manages to avoid all of Godzilla's atomic breath shots except for one which he tanks and then knocks out Godzilla clean securing a victory in round 2. Godzilla did win two fights but Kong still managed to secure one fight. And idk why you act like Kong holding his own against Godzilla underwater and even somehow managing to survive even with the humans help is a small task which it isn't. He clearly was sedated in that fight and was out of his element yet he still managed to match Godzilla physically.,2021-06-03T16:11:04Z,19,
To Ade,"@Aadrit Medhi What fight are we watching? Kong gets grappled by Godzilla, manages to grab his arms just in time to not get scratched, gets bitten and barely gets away by headbutting and kicking him. He doesn't take out Godzilla and for plot armor contrivances, Godzilla only uses his breath once when he's the farthest away from Kong. Even with clear plot armor, he survives the fight not by almost killing Godzilla, but by managing to get away. Also, how would I not know the fight when I'm commenting under a video of the fight.",2021-06-03T16:01:53Z,1,

Unknown,"@GMK 2001 so goji only won that battle cause kong was sleepy?
If u have 2 read the book to understand what happens in that scene then its just bad.
Again kong was at that moment not sleepy he was 100%  awake u can clearly c that on the display when they release him. Everyone can clearly c this. U can try and do as mouch bla bla but everyone can c it on the screen. Tell me is in the book written that he is sleepy in that moment when goji attacks? Or was he at his full power?",2021-06-02T21:25:48Z,1,
GMK 2001,@Unknown they knocked out kong using sedatives. The only reason why kong was moving around quickly was due to his adrenaline rush since he ae ambushed by godzilla by default kong was put into a fight or flight situation which is something all animals including humans have as a survival instinct. Not my fault you somehow can't comprehend the movies are not the only source of information in the monsterverse and the novelizations are the more completed versions of the movies. If your a fangirl of both you should be smart enough to see and comprehend kong was on sedatives even most kong fans know that,2021-06-01T12:20:07Z,0,

Sam Alexander,"@Trevor Philips His fights were the interesting parts. Also if you're comparing Kong to Godzilla in terms of character, Kong would always win. He's just more relatable to humans.

Shakityaa Sherwin,@Chanel Adriana and Kong was never called as the King of the monsters in the 80 years of his appearance. That title is owned by Godzilla only.,2021-06-01T03:45:41Z,2,
Shakityaa Sherwin,"@Chanel Adriana Godzilla's name is a gorilla + Whale (kujira in Japanese) = Gojira.
Godzilla's first movie 1954's American version in 1956 was named as Godzilla: King Of The Monsters and from very first movie he was regarded as the King of The Monsters and the one who started the kaiju genre. King Kong maybe the first but his movie was just adventure genre, and not kaiju genre. While Gojira 1954 started the kaiju genre with Kaiju/Tokusatsu/Horror Genre. Godzilla's roar is the symbol of Kaiju Genre. 
Godzilla's iconic stuff are: His roar, his dorsal plates, his theme, his atomic breath, the horror of nuclear weapons, Tokyo destruction, and literally everything with Godzilla is iconic. 
While Kong's iconic only for catching a blonde on top of the empire state building and nothing else. No hate, but get your points right before starting an conversation.",2021-06-01T03:43:07Z,0,
Trevor Philips,@Matthias Hernandez Or when Kong was always there you do realize he only appeared for Kong to fight that's his only purpose he's an obstacle for Kong he's not really the main protagonist not even an antagonist.

Matthias Hernandez,"@Trevor Philips What? His name is right before Kong's name in the movie title, how is Godzilla a supporting character??!! Yes they do give Kong a little bit more story in this film but Godzilla is a very big main character. 

Personally I was rooting for Godzilla but after seeing this film, I now have more respect for Kong. This whole ""It was an unfair fight, Godzilla cheated"" nonsense is bs because what weapon did Godzilla have to use, huh? Godzilla can't help with how he is, he has a tail, got claws and fangs, and has atomic breath. If anything, the director gave Kong an axe knowing that Kong was at a big disadvantage so Kong had a chance.",2021-06-01T01:39:34Z,2,

Trevor Philips,@Kessler Tripp-Wallace I think if Kong spared Godzilla in the end and then Mecha beats Kong to the ground putting him unconscious kinda would have made the movie better instead the movie wants you to think Godzilla wins even though the whole movie spend hours trying to make Kong win and if he didn't win then doesn't that make the entire journey pointless?,2021-05-31T22:40:31Z,1,
Chanel Adriana,RcGuitarCovers lol you have no idea how wrong you’re Adam is a Godzilla fan since childhood he said so himself. You probably been living under a rock to make such an ignorant comment.,2021-05-31T22:32:28Z,1,
RcGuitarCovers,"@Chanel Adriana the movie was clearly a kong bias film what are you talking about?70% of the movie was all kong while godzilla had barely 15 minutes of screentime. from a godzilla fanboy? bite me. adam is obviously a kong fanboy based on this movie. the only moment that godzilla had in this movie was the fight. he didnt have any characterization in this movie, all the characterization and badass moments went to kong, they humanized him while dragging godzilla 2 steps back making him a typical animal rampaging on cities.",2021-05-31T22:28:44Z,0,
Chanel Adriana,King Kong this whole film was biased towards Godzilla what’s you gotta say for that. From the beginning Godzilla was favoured,2021-05-31T22:16:44Z,0,
King Kong,Looooooool it was bias towards kong in every aspect but K,2021-05-31T22:13:50Z,0,
GMK 2001,@Chanel Adriana kong did not win this fight in no way or form the only fight he won was round 2 and that was with the axe. Stop being a keyboard warrior kid kong lost and there's no denying that. Stop using the mechagodzilla excuse when Adam said that fight was irrelevant to godzilla and kong's 3 main fights,2021-05-31T21:37:41Z,3,
Chanel Adriana,Kessler Tripp-Wallace when Kong hit Godzilla with the axe and both were down that’s when mecha Godzilla should’ve arrived and start mopping the floor with both them. But focusing on Godzilla more then when Kong gets up we see them taking on mecha and winning,2021-05-31T21:29:02Z,2,
the Yolo Gamer,@Chanel Adriana yeah tell me about it *starts drinking ur tears*,2021-05-31T21:27:27Z,2,
Chanel Adriana,Kessler Tripp-Wallace either Kong wins or neither wins and make Kong do some significant damage to Godzilla because this was poor showing there’s not a single scene where Godzilla was in any danger and that’s not how vs films work,2021-05-31T21:26:30Z,2,
Kessler Tripp-Wallace,I'm a Kong fan like you but I'm curious to know how you would have liked to see the movie play out,2021-05-31T21:19:39Z,2,

daboss258,@abdul baten Horrible explanation. What you said is complete nonsense. It’s been shown dozens of times how far the Avengers go to save civilian lives during a battle with an antagonist. Look at the Hulk vs Hulkbuster fight. Tony fights the most destructive hero in the MCU while making sure people around him are not getting killed. Godzilla and The Avengers have two different kinds of collateral damage. Do you see the Avengers purposely destroying bridges? Or bringing a tsunami to a beach? All the damage you see in the Marvel movies are literally the cause of the film’s villain. I’m not talking about the MUTOS or Ghidra. I’m talking about the bridge in Hong Kong and the tsunami in Honolulu. Godzilla is NOT heroic.,2021-06-06T18:01:10Z,1,
abdul baten,@daboss258 Avengers also killed people by saving other people that doesn't mean that they are not a hero and if he was not there then Ghidorah and Mutos will destroy the earth so GODZILLA IS HEROIC,2021-06-06T16:27:48Z,0,

GMK 2001,"@Mike Phelps kong is definitely smarter since he uses sign language. Kong's intelligence is similar to a human while godzilla's intelligence can be compared to that of a dolphin or a elephant. I say dolphin or elephant because those animals have  animalistic levels of intelligence but still have a human level of intelligence to them at the same time. So basically this sums up their intelligence 

Kong- all human intelligence 

Godzilla- 50% animal intelligence 50% human intelligence",2021-06-01T01:00:16Z,1,
