Mayank Agrawal,"For network problems -
1. I am sorry, I can't hear you. 
2. I am sorry, Your voice is breaking.
3. I am sorry, You are breaking.
4. I am sorry, your voice is jarring.
5. I am sorry, your voice is echoing.
6. I can hear you, but in bits and pieces.
7. I can hear you, on and off.
8. I can't hear you at all, let me call you back.
When you want to confirm whether your voice is clear or not to the other person.
9. Can you hear me loud and clear?
10. Am I audible to you?
11. Is my voice audible?
12. Am I audible because I am out on the road.
13. Is my voice too low?
14. Is my voice clear enough?
Answer to this question could be -
15. I can hear you but, your voice is too low, can you be a bit loud?
16. I am barely managing to hear?
17. I can hear you in pieces.

For low battery situation
1. Hey you have to be quick, my battery is about to die.
2. Before we start speaking, I might loose you, as I am on 3% battery.
3. Can I call you after charging my phone?
4. My battery is about to drain, could you text me, if it's not that important?
5. Let me grab a charger and I will call you back.
When you are busy
1. I am tied up at the moment, can I call you in an hours time? ( Tied up - busy )
2. If it's not urgent, can I buzz you later in the evening?
3. You just have two minutes, be quick in what you have to say.
4. I am about to start driving, I won't be able to have a long chat.
5. I am sure this conversation will take longer, can I reach home and call you?

When conversation has just been started and a third person wants to join - conference calls
1. Can I get Amit with us so that we can save time and have a clear discussion?
2. Wait let me rope in Anjali into this call.
3. Hi, I have Amit with me on the other side, I am patching you in.
Now when you all are connected and you want to confirm whether you are audible to both/all of them or not.
4. Can both of you hear me clearly?
5. Am I audible to both of you?
If you want to disconnect one person and continue with another.
6.Amit please stay on the line, Anjali you could disconnect, I will call you later.

Before ending a call -
1. It was a great conversation, let's connect regularly.
2. Take care, let's be in touch.
3. My battery is running low, I might loose you soon.
4. I need to hang up now, lets continue our conversation tomorrow.
5. It's been an hour we are talking, I need to get back to work.
6. Hey, listen, my class is about to start, I won't be able to speak to you now.

Your conversation is ongoing and you are getting a second call -
1. I am getting a second call, could you hold for a sec/min.
2. Hi, I am speaking to someone on the other side, if it's not urgent, can I call you in sometime?
3. I am getting a call from my boss, I will have to answer, I will call you back soon.

If you have said someone that you will call in sometime and you don't call back or you don't answer to the 2nd call -
1. I am sorry, you had to wait longer.
2. Please hold on a sec, my boss is pinging me.",2020-08-22T12:24:13Z,0,0

Chetan Pithadiya,"British rule was better than Indian politics. It's a very long story I have written an article about Indian political parties as well. I am also a leader of BJP. I love my party. But I would like to say that in India many political leaders are currupt. In future curruption would not stop but it'll increased. The most currupted party is Congress and I can prove it, not only I have also the proof of this party. India got a indepence in 1947 at that time Congress was everywhere in our India. And now my Gujarati hero shree honerabe pm modi is doing something good for our country then why Congress party try to their leg inside. Our pm taken a right decision. Salute him from the bottom of my heart. Here currupt is Congress but BJP Moto is clean the curruption as much as possible and punish currut officer and politicians.
